Ok, now the function is written - however, this is only half the battle.  Now we have to create/edit the document you are using so the above code actually works! :)

1)  Open your document.  If you do not have a current 
    document that you are not using, create a new one.

2)  In the places where the values will change based on 
    information in the record, create a bookmark and name 
    it appropriately.  i.e. If you have a field in Access 
    called FirstName, then make the bookmark name "First 
    Name", etc etc

3)  After creating / editing your document, save it.  
    Remember the file name.

4)  Back to Access!  Create a button on a form somewhere, 
    and name it appropriately (ie cmdMerge, cmdMakeLetter, 
    etc)

5)  In the On_Click event of your button, use an event 
    procedure and add the following line of code:

    CreateWordLetter "<path to your document>"

6)  Watch everything kick into action! :)
